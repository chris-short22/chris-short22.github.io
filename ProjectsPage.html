        <p>
            During my time at OU I have had to do many projects in my classes. Some that stand out are my Business Communication Team project and the
            Client Database project.
        </p>

        <h3>Business Communication project</h3>
        <p>
            During this project I was in a small team of 5 people. Our goal was to come up with a fictional company and make a detailed presentation about business
            strategies and how we would be able to enter the market and compete with the established companies.
        </p>

        <h3>Database project</h3>
        <p>
            This was another team project. This project involved building a functioning database in Microsoft SQL Server. We built it based off of a list of client
            criteria. This project took around 3 months from start to finish. It involved creating each table in the database and making sure that all of the relationships between
            them would allow us to execute the desired SQL queries.
