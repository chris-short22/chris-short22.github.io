            My name is Christopher Short. I am a student in the Price College of Business at the University of Oklahoma. I am majoring in Management Information Systems with a Minor in Marketing.
            I am schduled to graduate in December of 2022. The classes I enjoyed the most during my time at OU so far are Databases, Programming, and Marketing Research.
        </p>

            In addition to courses I am taking, I am pursuing a certification as a SalesForce Administrator. This involves going through a training program that 
            teaches you all of the details in SalesForce followed by an exam.
